//----CORRECT CODE----
//Variable Declaration with initialization
float b=3.2;
//Variable Declaration
int a;
//Variable assignment
a=5;
//another assignment
a=8;
//Declaring and initializaing char
char aChar='c';
//Declaring and initializaing string
string aString="I am a String";
//assigning a variable to another
int b=8;
a=b;
//addition and subtraction operations
int c=8;
a=b+c;
a=b-c;
//empty statement
;;;;
// just a variable , but our grammer doesn't support just a value (ex: 5;)
a;
